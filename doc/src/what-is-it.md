# what is it ?

This is a pre-processor, that allows you to render animation for mermaid diagrams, if you use mdbook to manage your
documentation written as `.md` files.

- Look at [demos](demos.md) to look what it does.
- Look at [installation](install.md) to look how to install it. If you already use mdbook, it is one line in you `book.toml` file.
- Loot at [usage](usage.md) to see how to configure a diagram. The configuration is a yml file, so you can easily handle that with other tools.
